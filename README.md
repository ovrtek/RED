# Cybercore RED

This is honestly just an experiment to see if I had what it takes to program my own game engine using the same scenario and mechanics as my first project, so it’s time to see what I am truly capable of as a programmer!

In this version the goal is to bust 1000 viruses and after every 250 you fight one of the four antivirus bosses, so it is pretty much a glorified Devil May Cry Bloody Palace except the format is similar to the Baldr Sky Survival Mode which is a perfect endurance test for the antivirus avatar!

This game was made completely in C++ so it might be rough around the edges in some spots, but if you’re interested in creating your own Cybercore style game it is a solid template to build from!

- W to move your AV forward
