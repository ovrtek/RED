# Cybercore RED

This is honestly just an experiment to see if I had what it takes to program my own game engine using the same scenario and mechanics as my first project, so it’s time to see what I am truly capable of as a programmer!

In this version there’s an entire global grid to explore and defend against the virus infection with the antivirus avatar. The light loadout customization and simulated leaderboard are from Armored Core while the virus legion being able to capture unguarded territory is from Extreme Power!

This game was coded completely in C++ so it might be rough around the edges in some spots, but if you’re interested in creating your own Cybercore style game it’s a solid template to start from!
